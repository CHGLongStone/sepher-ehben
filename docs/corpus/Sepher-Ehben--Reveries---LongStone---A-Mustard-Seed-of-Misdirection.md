#### Jordan Peterson quoted…

> "Conservatives actually have something to sell young people, they could sell them responsibility!"

Again to quote. "**_WRONG_**", _emphatically_

It is **_people with integrity that teach people with and to,  
engender responsibility_**.

Conservatives offer a routine of going through the motions.

Liberals think a skim of glue will substitute for the equation of a simple lever in their "cant I lever" architecture.

Am I Wright? Or being too Frank?
