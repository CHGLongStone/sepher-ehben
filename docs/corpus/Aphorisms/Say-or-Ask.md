# Sepher Ehben: Aphorisms- Say or Ask

When you look at the person you have bonded with, say to them 3 things every day.

When you look at the person you have bonded with, say to them 3 things every day.

Hey beautiful

I love you

I’m grateful you’re in my life

If not, then ask

Why you can’t  
Why "we" can’t  
Why they can’t

In that order
