# Sepher Ehben: Hymns to the Logos — A call to Prayer for the disaffected

Political ideologues, intellectually un-deft, bereft of nuance and subtly, convinced of the Reich-ness of their dis-position. Gulags of…

Political ideologues, intellectually un-deft,   
bereft of nuance and subtly,   
convinced of the Reich-ness   
of their dis-position.   
Gulags of thought crimes   
imposed by states of consciousness   
corrupted by a seed of infatalizing help   
wrapped in a cognitive cancer   
metastasizing when it does not   
receive prognosis.

Hatfields and McCoy’s   
locked into a blood feud of inbred thought,   
raucous lobsters,   
shit throwing monkeys.   
None being able   
to pull their heads out of their a..nger long enough…  
to step back and observe   
the entirety of the situation   
their crude brutality in response to provocation   
and the dismal ignorance of their consternation   
because their minds   
are just busy bees   
until their queen   
is sorted  
in her nest.

Their war horse is just a pack mule   
ready to fall off a cliff   
carrying the baggage of…  
who the fuck knows their masters or motivations…   
into personal oblivion.   
These beasts of burden   
have no clear reckoning   
of their own intent   
or desires.   
They have no king   
who can cleave the language   
or constructs   
of a self-evident treaty that will leave   
the well-being of the contested child intact…

Their multiplication is bad,   
division is bad,   
addition and subtraction are sins   
and hierarchy is damnation,   
confined to evil   
are basic principles of organization?   
I’ve heard a thousand crystal palace stories   
and they all fracture   
under the lightest stress

So don’t tell me,

SHOW me how your fantasy or delusion is different…

So hyper-attenuated is the envelope   
of perception and response,   
constrained and filtered to a projection of insult   
triggered by any and all stimulus   
that doesn’t fit their comfort zone   
or construct of how   
“people are supposed to be or act”.   
Beta-male jihadis, antifas and allies   
rising from the destruction   
of all functional structure,   
opportunity   
and meaning   
except…  
the responsibilities of others   
projected onto the inadequacy   
of your ability   
to fill the hollow dream   
that you bathed in   
while you danced   
in its barren   
and diminishing   
light

The childish ignorance   
of having a single word or phrase   
explaining a world view…  
so intellectually unrefined…  
could such a crude answer   
stand the frontiers of your curiosity?   
test the limits of every methodology within your grasp?   
Surely this mantra of yours   
that you’ve built the foundation of your WHOLE identity ON   
shouldn’t be a castle in the sand   
unless you are a child on the beach   
lost in the imagination   
of a sunny afternoon

Or does your mantra run like   
the thump, thump, thump of a helicopter parent?  
washing over the personal boundaries   
of everyone in sight   
hovering with anxious neuroticism   
to ensure everything is nerfed   
and no firm boundaries   
or sharp contradictions   
should ever present themselves   
in the comfort zone that extends   
as far as your eyes or pixels might reach

If you want to be treated like an adult   
then fucking act like one   
and keep your ego state   
in check   
and   
stop   
trying   
to project   
the misery of   
YOUR failed responsibilities   
onto the dignity   
of other human beings…  
Clean your room…  
expand your domains of mastery over self   
and clean the rooms of your inner being.   
Build a wing for all those things   
you wish to do in your life   
and don’t let it become decrepit

Build a terrace   
to step back and observe your garden   
of earthly delights with some objectivity   
and see that they are both tended and orderly   
so that you may enjoy them   
and they do not entrap others

But most importantly,   
build your inner sanctum,   
your secret vault   
and holy of holies   
and in all the accumulations   
of your travels and adventures   
into glory   
and descents   
into misery and turmoil   
never keep anything in there   
that hasn’t proven itself   
to be truly worthy

You can cover yourself   
in golden accouterments   
or hide them in a lair   
under the watchful eye   
of a green dragon   
or you can transcend   
the crude little meat bag…  
and collect those things   
which irradiate golden opportunities   
upon you   
and those around you

You can collect those things   
that provided a glimmer of hope   
in abject darkness   
or a tested and tempered strand of thought   
to pick the locks   
of self-imposed psychological prison cells   
of deprivation and neglect   
faced by the prisoners of war   
of these tin soldier battles  
and bring some light   
into the world
