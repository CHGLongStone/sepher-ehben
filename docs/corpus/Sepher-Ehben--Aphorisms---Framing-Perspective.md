# Sepher Ehben: Aphorisms — Framing Perspective
## Many esoteric axioms are actually "litmus tests" of perspective testing the apprehension and comprehension of the initiate.

The deeper mysteries have long known the dangers of pearls before swine and sharp tools in the grasp of dull minds.

Paul Foster Case started a a tradition with the Builders of the Adytum and his unencrypted publication of the Tarot, the barrier to entry was the application of your own discipline and not parsing proprietary obfuscation, opensource came to mystery tradition.

The Case Deck must be colored by the initiate.

“Rota Tarot Orat Torah Ator”,

“The wheel of tarot speaks the law of Hathor (Venus)”,

“the wheel of archetypes speaks the law of biology, and that generative pattern of consciousness has 5 dimensions”.

### Volume Of The Sacred Law: the foundation of Masonic Tradition

Within the jurisdiction to which I am bound I have seen Brethren give obligations on the King James, the Torah and the Koran. When a Brother has joined a Lodge his [Volume Of The Sacred Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_Sacred_Law) must be present and open so long as his name on the role is to be found.

Freemasonry postulates “a moral science”, a Philosopher’s Stone, though object lessons exceed the efficacy of moral posturing and obligations exercise the application of discipline.

We refer to a “Volume Of Sacred Law” as a peice of paper and we do not recognize that the poesis of divinity has always been constrained to four letters [AGCT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA).

A developed moral science must address the mess and complexity of human experience and address the dis-ease and dis-stress that contorts and distorts our being from the psycho-social and emotional to the biological.

### Tetragrammaton: the glyph of the Logos

Genesis 1:27 uses Elohim in the passage “created man in his own image” but “Ha Shem"\* (the tetragrammaton written vertically elucidates the “metaphorce” more clearly) as does John 5:53, “I am come in my Father’s name”, If you have a sense of Hebrew linguistic humor or look at the original characters of the Hebrew alephbet.

Each of the letters represent a noun and number as well as the character in a strange and unique concordance and coherence.

"Ha Shem" when written vertically is an anthropomorphic glyph. Yod representing the head, Heh for the shoulders, Vav for the torso, Heh for the hips and legs. The word is a composite of the past, present and future tenses of the verb "to be"

Yod represents the hand of the “Rabbi” and the index finger pointing towards the numinous, the accumulation of focus to the highest objective.

**Stand up straight. Embody the Logos.**

Heh is a Window (frame of reference) represents the “upper covenant”, the obligation of true speech and the avoidance of corruption or manipulation.

**Be at attentive awareness, do not raise your hands to meddle in the affairs of others who are not in genuine distress.**

Vav is a Nail affixing the first frame of reference to the next in a coherent structure.

**A spine that is still straight under the burden of suffering that awareness brings has strength to share.**

Heh repeated represents the lower covenant, the obligation of true action. The error check that your walk matches your talk forthrightly.

**If you have any integrity your perspective is from the shoulders of giants not from the backs of others.**

### Tenderness of the Great Beast

> “do what thou wilt shall be the the whole of the law”

> “Love is the law, love under will.”

Like many early schools, the <cough> “Master of the New Aeon” liked to think his job security was tied to its obfuscation. The first statement is the most profound and not fully comprehended until the later is.

“love under will” is regarded by the profane as a subjugation, with a true understanding of the sacred it is felt as the foundation, “do what thou wilt” is an integration of “divine sight” for the Logos looks upon the heart of self and the sight of ignorant man only sees the skin of the surface layer,

True will is the will of the Logos.

\*HaShem — while cross checking some etymology for another article (link here when published) I came across a [gnostic reference ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineffability).
