> To extend the analogy of an ocean perhaps rather crudely, it is as though in places its waters become frozen into lumps to form matter, and these lumps melt back into the ocean, while freezing takes place in other ares to produce different ‘solid pieces’ of ocean. This process of freezing, melting and refreezing is continuous and infinite, constantly repeating itself over incalculable lengths of time. — Ikuko Osumi from ‘The Shamanic Healer: The Healing World of Ikuko Osumi and the Traditional Art of Seiki Jutsu’ by Malcolm Ritchie

This quote spoke to me deeply as evocative of Nietzsche's eternal return and now seems a prescient description of emergence theory.

The diagram below was an attempt to visualize the paragraph above, the ocean mapped to a torus and the rational planes of material presence inter-mediated by non rational relationships. In the zero time of the eternal now we experience temporal movement as the transformation of our perspective in environment. The more accurate the representations of our models, the less deterministic. We can only abstract to a horizon of expectation, we can only extract from the past to a threshold of historic dissolution.

The tetrahedron has also been a fundamental construct in this journey. First mapping the tri-grams of the I Ching against a star tetrahedron with a behavioral model my friend Alexander Stewart had developed Desire-Assumption-Intention-Initiation. Initiation mapped to the vertical axis, one frame mapped to processing incoming information, the other mapped to framing our past.

#### Revelation

[**Revelation - Wikipedia**  
_In the Abrahamic religions, the term is used to refer to the process by which God reveals knowledge of himself, his…_en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation")[](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation)

Revelation in the popular mind of the west is almost exclusively the domain of Christian zealots and fundamentalists like much of the linguistic and conceptual domains around mysticism and religious experience but revelation plays a role in many religious traditions. It is not a leap to simply view revelation through its paleolithic shamanic context as ecstatic experience that is further shaped by the set and setting of culture and context. From Zen Buddhisms “sudden enlightenment” to Eureka moments in science what is now usually referred to as “peak experience/flow state” has a wide range of affect and manifestation.

Eureka moments in science and mysticism should mark the beginning of work and the application of methodological diligence not the end of inquiry. Theory untested by the fire of real world application is juvenile hubris.

Experiences of revelation are often overwhelmingly emotive, treat trying to understanding the experience is what needs serious attention, not your ego.

_If your ego comes out intact or indulgent, you’re not doing it right._

#### Unraveling the Chaos

Stating that these experiences are difficult to understand rationally is true, possibly an understatement. Stating that they cannot be understood at least in part rationally is utter bullshit. The comprehension can not be only through a rational frame as these experiences are multidimensional…yet the wider understanding of the interrelated domains of experience can deepen the rational comprehension of the experience.

Paul Devereaux and members of the Dragon Project (Trust) undertook a project that started around my birth and carried on for two decades to gather as much physical and sensor data as possible to try and at least determine correlative patterns between geophysiology and paranormal experience.

Michael Persinger was actively studying the effects of electromagnetic waves on the brain and reproducing experiences of revelation through stimulation. Bin-aural audio stimulation, spacialized sound and other forms of sensory entrainment have also been widely explored.

Others have dug into the anthropological record of shamanic experience to find records of the entoptic patterns that still appear to explorers of this space as well as through later written transmission of experience to determine what type of entheogen the author had consumed from the characteristics of their linguistic patterns.

The language of archetypes gives us yet another frame to parse some aspect of meaning from these experiences. The landscape is difficult but we are not bereft of tools in our attempts to grasp an understanding of it.

#### Believe Half of What You See, Nothing of What You Hear.

A hypothesis is useless if un-testable an application worthless if it can not facilitate actual users in the real world. “Ivory Towers of Enlightenment” are a perverse fairy tale of relative poverty but mountains only be ranges of madness if they are insurmountable.

I take the following constructs to be plausible enough to work with:

*   existence is conscious down to the Planck tetrahedral pixel of emergence theory
*   The construct of the Logos is the appropriate level of relationship to the ineffable and the engagement of true speech and action is the most appropriate embodiment.
*   The development of the modes of thinking delineated by the Flynn effect and Alexander Luria’s work, recapitulated by Piaget, integrated with the previous 2 constructs can provide a framework that is open, accessible yet still deeply grounded in cultural tradition and rational thought.

From Piaget’s model I would separate comparison at the next developmental level as introspection, or meta-cognition.

Abstraction with the application of logical reasoning, effective application of the hypothetical (deductive reasoning) and classification forming the base tetrad, introspection forming the elevated point of the tetrahedron, mimicking the most elemental unit of consciousness.

#### Enter the Tetragramaton: Constructs of the Logos

The tetragrammaton or “Ha Shem” (“The Name” ) is a combination of the past, present and future tenses of the verb “to be”. The Glyph written vertically is anthropomorphic and esoteric. The Logos is the pattern of (pure) consciousness from which we abstract our own concrete implementations. We are in that essence “The Word/Name become flesh” as much as we are if we view “the word(s)” as a combination of nucleotides.

The characters of the name represent:

*   Yod — the index finger of the Rabbi pointing to the divine
*   Heh — a “window” (frame of reference)
*   Vav — a “nail” (to bind)
*   Heh — the next “wndow” (frame of reference)

Comparatively

Jesus (Joshua/Yeshua, bit of the old tooth an nail) יושוע

*   Yod — …Rabbi pointing to the divine
*   Vav — nail (to bind)
*   Shin — tooth/fang (mastication)
*   Vav — nail (to bind)
*   Ayin — eye (observation/awareness)

Yeesos (masculine future passive tense of happiness — ”he will be merry”) ישיש

*   Yod — …Rabbi pointing to the divine
*   Shin — tooth/fang (mastication)
*   Yod — …Rabbi pointing to the divine
*   Shin — tooth/fang (mastication)

A little bit of etymological comprehension goes a long way, getting a bit of a grasp Hebrew etymological humor helps as well.

None of this supports the infantile representations put forth and argued over by rabid theists or anti-theists. In fact they argue because they are trapped in concrete representation and can’t even follow the argument into the requisite degree of complexity in the details nor elevate the abstraction enough to glean a horizon of broader context.

#### 4th dimensional consciousness

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*WbtcN4Q8dxpJpuKh0tsELw.jpeg)

1 Samuel 16:7 _“for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.”_ Divine vision/elevated intellect is addressing complexity the underdeveloped human intellect is fixated on superficiality.

I take the glyph of the tetragrammaton and the cube of space in Sepher Ytzirah to be the implication and evocation of a hyper-cube of consciousness.

From the 3 dimensional construct of the concrete mind, extrapolations of “that which was, is, and shall be” (frames of temporal reference) are the first 4th dimensional projection.

The Cube of Space delineated in Sepher Ytzirah also seems to evoke a 4th dimensional hyper-cube

If we take the “chunking” aspect of Cognitive Load theory I think it plausible that the Sigma boundaries in IQ map to the number of “chunks” (and their complexity through schematizing) that we are able to maintain in conscious thinking, these in turn map to the projected surfaces of the hyper-cube, in some degree the ability to fully form the hyper-cube is dependent on the ability to hold and form those buckets at the appropriate level of complexity.

Nelson Cowan’s constraining to 4 chunks down from G.A. Miller’s 7 (+/-2) would seem to account for sigma boundary changes due to the Flynn effect and its decline since 1970.

#### Neural Plasticity and the Development of Extrapolated Frames of Reference

I think it plausible that domains of knowledge and experience are first extrapolated as 4th dimensional projections of consciousness and that these projections are distinctive clusters based on the groups of cognitive skills required for proficiency and then flow state within the particular domain. The flow state for root cause analysis is different from the flow state for complex systems or data architecture which is in turn different from the flow state of room clearing in close quarters combat which is in turn different from the flow state of of long range precision shooting. In each of these domains “sin” (the failure to hit the mark competently) has the potential for critical or catastrophic consequences for failure which means the the behavioral responses and cognitive systems developed to support these different domains will be highly optimized for those specific domains.

The greater range and inter-relatedness of the domains of experience we access they more effectively we can synthesize transferable skill sets. At least the basis for the pattern has been encoded, even if it takes longer later life to transition from one domain/flow state to another, they are still available even when the neural plasticity required to develop new domains has diminished with time.

[Éliphas Lévi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89liphas_L%C3%A9vi) once pronounced

> “An imprisoned person with no other book than the Tarot, if he knew how to use it, could in a few years acquire universal knowledge, and would be able to speak on all subjects with unequaled learning and inexhaustible eloquence.” Transcendental Magic. p. 103

The Tarot being the most current and developed distillation of the archetypal mysteries available to him.

I think his attitude is a bit ivory tower.

You can learn process optimization or other aspects of systems level thinking as a dish pig, heavy stamp operator, ditch digger all the way up to systems architect.

**_EVERY domain of experience is an opportunity to learn_** _even if society at large offers little guidance besides how not to do things._ Focus on basic familiarity with many domains before you constrain to a single one. _Better to be a “jack of all trades”_ than the intellectual overlord or master of the Bates Motel.

Initiation as a junior or “Entered Apprentice” to use the Masonic term in the progression of mastery, is the extrapolation of that 4th dimension within a domain of knowledge or experience.

The next step is developing an intermediate level of mastery or “Fellow Craft” to use the Masonic term. One has achieved enough competence to be recognized as a “fellow of the craft” to use the academic connotation of fellow.

The final step in the physical dimension is the 10K commitment, Master of the “Craft” (4th dimension extrapolation), the next step in the developmental progression is to engage the deeper “hidden mysteries” of the domain if they have not yet begun to illuminate themselves.
