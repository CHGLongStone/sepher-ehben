# Sepher Ehben: Aphorisims — 2 sides

I don’t even remember what the original discussion was  Or who it was with Only that it was engaged but not heated  Until it was…

I don’t even remember what the original discussion was   
Or who it was with  
Only that it was engaged but not heated   
Until it was interrupted by  
“there are two sides to every story”  
Unacknowledged it came louder  
“You KNOW there are two sides to every story…”

Now the look in response must have conveyed to them  
A lack of comprehension which was actually incredulousness   
And again they started “You know there are two sides…”  
What kind of Cartesian constrained intellectual flat earthism is that!  
Was not the reply they expected …  
I live in a world of 3 physical dimensions creating a continuum of of at least six different perspectives   
1080 composite degrees of distinction   
64,800 minutes   
3,888,000 seconds of variation   
So tell me again how “2 sides allows” me to model anything meaningful in a world of human complexity

The way your argument is construed and constrained   
Your premise is maintained   
until the knowledge from which you refrained  
Fills in and refines the context of your exposition  
Shows the true colours of your disposition   
Like a toddler holding up a handful of its own shit  
With a smile that says “look what I created”

Build that echo chamber   
Bigger, better stronger  
With more reverb, more sustain  
Until nothing but that single phrase mantra remains  
Alahu Akbar   
Praise Jesus  
Patriarchy…
