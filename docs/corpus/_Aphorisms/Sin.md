# Sepher Ehben: Aphorisms — Sin

Original sin, etymologically was an admonishment to mastery appropriate to the instruction of someone developing until it became a doctrine…

Original sin, etymologically was an admonishment to mastery appropriate to the instruction of someone developing until it became a doctrine under bureaucracy and a dogma under hypocrisy. Lexical fields salted by a corruption in history quelling the growth of effective discrimination and obscuring the golden currencies of deep historical experience and ancient universal mysteries now encrusted with suspicion.

All roads to the avoidance of self lead one back to the gates of Chapel Perilous until there is no dead wood left to build a pire at the cross roads of existence and the things that only manifest in the low light of the archetype deeper than the antumbra. You have no claim to the weird unless you have passed through the veil of the occult to that undiscovered country within and retrieved something of value to yourself or others.

7 inate tribal sins precede 3 sins of citizenship in the development of a civil society and complexity is the barbarian at the gates.

The failure to _hit the mark_ with abstraction and the application of logical reasoning, effective risk assessment of the hypothetical and the resolution of classification.

Abstraction without logical reasoning degrades into neurosis and logical reasoning without abstraction degrades into a fixed focus perspective.

Being chicken little or crying wolf is no more useful than failing to recognize a threat even when the messenger might be one who exercises distress as a cry for attention.

The resolution of classification shifts across scales and without the appropriate order of magnification, is as contextually useless as fixed focus or a pin hole.

The appropriate orders of magnitude in resolution are referential.
