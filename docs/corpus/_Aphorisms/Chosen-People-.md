# Sepher Ehben: Aphorisms — Chosen People…

Chosen? Chosen by what? The integrity and the extent To which you embody your covenant?

Chosen?   
Chosen by what?  
The integrity and the extent   
To which you embody your covenant?

Or more likely

Some resent expressed in entitlement  
Ego caught like a moth  
in the glamour of a "personal"  
guardian angel…

Failing to understand the abstraction  
Before the implementation.  
Results in unrecoverable application failure  
Within the domains of logos and ethos

While pathos continues to compile  
Substrates of machination for argument.  
Manipulation for intent.  
This is what you would elevate?

Great and terrible infantilism,  
Of self importance and self indulgence.  
As if whim were a need,  
Worth more than another’s dignity.

This is what you would elevate?

If you can’t distinguish a boss from a leader,  
You have earned your fate.   
Leaded your keel,  
Yet left your rudder astray.

A true crown is thorny  
With the responsibilities of stewardship.  
A gilded brocade is worthless if it does not   
Have any weight, again, take care to what you elevate.
