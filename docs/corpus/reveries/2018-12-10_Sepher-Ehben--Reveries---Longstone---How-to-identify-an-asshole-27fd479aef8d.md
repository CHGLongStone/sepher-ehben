How to identify an asshole  
First we need to define our boundaries   
Since we’re looking at a list we need some   
Quantitative and qualitative distinctions rather than  
Just whining about not liking someone

I’ve long preferred the definition   
an asshole is “someone who gets upset   
If you treat them, the same way they treat you”  
I like the definition because it touches both   
The hypocrisy and the underlying abusiveness
