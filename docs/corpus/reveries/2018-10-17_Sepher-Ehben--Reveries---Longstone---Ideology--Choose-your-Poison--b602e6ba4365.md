If the statement offends you it is simply an indication of the depth of your indoctrination or your misapprehension of my language. I am responsible for what I say, not for what you understand. I am not drawing a line in the sand with with a sweep of the foot, I am laying it grain by grain with the attention of Tenzin creating a mandala.

#### Ideology is a failed state of consciousness.

It DOES NOT MATTER what the ideology is, or from what orthodoxy the dogma emanates.

If you “believe in science” you are caught by orthodoxy.

If you have confidence in the _scientific method_ **_and_** _its diligent application, THAT_ is an entirely reasonable proposition. If that distinction isn’t meaningful read it again. If it takes more than 3 times to comprehend, leave this and speak no further…but come back when you do.

You are _NOT prepared to address any subject that reaches the level of complexity of ANY aspect of public policy_. Were it not for the emphatic thumping I could say “it’s an observation not a judgment” but it is both without question.

Maybe I reveal too much of myself in delineating my boundary between recognizing you as an individuated being and dismissing you as an automaton of the biomass, undifferentiated from your nurture, disconnected from the nature of your being washing down the river of existence in a bubble that mirrors the extent of your grasp.

…Chest thumping tribal bullshit and why the fuck should they?

In deep seriousness.

Why the fuck should they?

Outside of that myopic domain of reference what value do you bring with you? What problems are you qualified to address?

If you hesitated before responding, proceed.

At least you took the _time to consider_, before responding, proceed.

Hopefully you picked something other than a low hanging fruit on the tree of knowledge or something rotten and fermented off the ground, drunk like cattle stumbling in the flat field of your isolated existence. I do get bored of the fumbling.

Caught a thread of corruption in the oldest social institutions? Good for you Master Of The Fucking Obvious. Congratulations on reaching cognitive puberty. If you don’t understand the descent from homodoxy into orthodoxy and ideology that affects every domain of human cognition from religion to science.

My mechanical Canadian apologies, I still can’t take you seriously.

The lack of situational awareness to differentiate pattern from context leaves you relevant only in the confines of your cognitive isolation chamber, an emergent order of magnitude short of a functional methodology. GoTo statements referencing to buckets of facts are a form of self-soothing intellectual masturbation at best.

If someone tells you to pick a side, tell them to go fuck themselves until they can come back with a perspective that is at least isometric.

The problems we face aren’t seesaws or tug of war and the playground conceptualization ensures we will never resolve them as adults.
