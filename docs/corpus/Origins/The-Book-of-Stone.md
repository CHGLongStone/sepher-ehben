#### Where to start such a journey…

In the beginning with Yir’ah,

Genesis 1:31 “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.”

וירא אלהים את־כל־אשר עשה והנה־טוב מאד ויהי־ערב ויהי־בקר יום הששי׃ פ

And in the summary of a contextual conversation with a friend who is a native speaker of Hebrew.

> \- Interestingly, "Va-yira"/"Va-yaar" (the first word) is also the root for fear  
> \- So a slightly awkward interpretation of the same phrase could be along the lines of:  
> "And G-d feared all that he had done, and this was very good"  
> \-Hebrew is a nifty language  
> \-"fear" may be too strong. "apprehension" maybe  
> \-G-d was apprehensive of all that he had done, and this was very good  
> \* wary  
> \- yes  
> \- Yir’a(h) is the pious fear man should have of the divine. same root is used  
> \- it’s a type of trembling humility

When one undertakes an endeavor of significant complexity and “flips the switch” in a “production environment”, one that has meaningful consequences to both the inhabitants of that environment and those who maintain it, “wary” and attentive is the appropriate attitude of any architect, “and this was good” is an optimistic simplification.

Amalgamating the last two lines reframed in Jordan Peterson’s construct of the logos, “Yir’ah is the pious apprehension and humility appropriate to approaching the logos having faced “the dragon of chaos” and “the abyss”.

Understanding Peterson’s perspective or the manifestation of the Intellectual Deep Web requires an engagement and a tool set more refined than ideological fundamentalism or disassociative materialism . If you’re arguing over for/against “a bearded guy in the sky” you are trapped in a concrete world and deeper mysticism is unavailable to you by your own choices or limitations, it does not mean there is nothing for you to learn, only that the learning curve will be steep and you must sacrifice of yourself to it, through the application of discipline if you want to move forward in life.

If you want to “change the world” you had best move far beyond “cleaning your room” to working the inner forge of “Chapel Perilous” with enough dexterity to effectively harden your resolve while tempering your extremities with a deep sense of humility.

You don’t need to be a Saint or a Bodhisattva to make a difference in the world, acting with personal integrity is the most meaningful act of resistance in a corrupt society.

#### What is worthy of being written in stone?

The things that can truly enlighten us to our selves, our societies and subcultures, our biologically evolutionary beings and our places within that multidimensional substrate.
