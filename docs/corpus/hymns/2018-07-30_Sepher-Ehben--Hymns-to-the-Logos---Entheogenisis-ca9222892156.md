In the beginning was the word  
And the word was with the Logos  
And the word was the Logos  
The generative construct   
that impregnates the material   
with potential

“Ha Shem”

The ineffable name of  
That which was,   
That which is,   
That which shall be  
The crytic gate keeper   
Of Nothingness,   
Limitless Nothingness,   
Limitless Light

Which has become enfolded   
And transubstantiated into   
the corporeal  
Binding layers of number letter and sound in rational dimension  
Mediated and interlaced   
through orders of magnitude  
Through patterns   
of irrational proportion

“Ha Shem”

The glyph   
and the construct of the logos  
The focus of will in alignment with the most elevated  
Through a coherent frame of reference of action  
bound to a coherent frame of reference of destination   
Aligned with a tempered strand of thought   
From the alpha of the past   
To the omega of the future  
Our self authorship is written in its image

“Ha Shem”

Because   
giving “the name” of one’s own relationship   
To the numinous, for another to use   
Is a profanity of the necessarily personal journey   
Implementing your own concrete instantiation  
Of the abstract base of the Logos   
Defining it’s interface through your inner cartography   
To generate the maps of meaning of YOUR OWN existence
