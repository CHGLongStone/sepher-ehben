Dancing Shaman: “open and receptive”. Soapstone, Beach pebble, rodent bones, locust thorns.

A point of true realization is something you can't turn away from without inviting karmic peril. The realization is indelible no matter how many layers of denial or substance abuse may obscure it. The failure to integrate this point of clairity will loose it in tethered in subconscious poking at soft bits, pointing out its lesson repeatedly until it is accepted.
