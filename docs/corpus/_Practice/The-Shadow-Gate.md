### It matters not that you hear the music, you must feel in your chest to shake your being free of the dross and the deadwood.

#### Approaching the Shadow Gate

The journey into shadow always begins in the same place in the same condition.

South of heaven, with grave wisdom, into the collapse of empires and dancing with strange bedfellows until the system ends and we face the crossing of the inner desert with nothing to keep one warm but impotent rage or burning the dead wood of self until nothing is left but the choice of vanquishing in that inner abyss or surrendering to the Biologial machine, driven by logos towards the telos of Being” waits for none but continues to lay the risers of the ladders which we may ascend.

#### Portico of the Shadow Gate

In the surrender to the loss of control of the ego state, “dead yet dreaming”, we may **_become_** a liminal one, carpe somnium, break free the confines of your mind, for “you can’t hide and you cannot die” in the dreams of the elysian summerland or chapel perilous.

“Wir sind zeitlos,” Und doch ist alles tot

“Pray now”, from extasis to catharsis and back,

Face the mirror, we become the change in our sphere of influence, embrace change before you must become enraptured to accept it.

“Are you ready for this?” Give Leviathan its due. A pound or two of desicated flesh from your inventory of wasted self interest or your future potential? Choose.

“Let us gather the halucinations of our private minds” pilgrims of the psychonaughts journey and illuminate your cartography.

Pray now in the most ancient of incantations to the sun and the moon, the logos and leviathan locked in this beautiful and terrible dance of existence.

I pray now…

before I face the Ruach Elohim

#### Crucible of the Umbra

The breath and voice of fire and emmanation in it’s complexity, wash over and consume me, completely…can you ride the wave? or are you scrambling to evade the flood of traumatic tones washing over your experience.

Can YOU stare into the blast furnace of creation and _ride its wave like a “welcome home”_?

Thought not…you basic. In truth, knew so when you asked for a check boxes to navigate you through the storm of consciousness.

Bitch…please, cutting this wind would bring your world down in fire

“Bring The Noise” into the greatest purity of sonic envelope construction ever concieved (imo)…burn baby, burn? you can’t handle the reflection of the truth

Bitch…please, “here we go again…BRING THE NOISE!”

bring the chaos and burn…

BURN, BABY, BURN…burn the deadwood of the hindrances to your expression of being. No one else can kraak your habits until you do so yourself!

You will NEVER see the beauty in the hurricane’s eye when you shelter from the wind.

The heuristic, is only intrinsic, at a refned degree of magnification or resolution.

Your diamond days are cut and dry.
