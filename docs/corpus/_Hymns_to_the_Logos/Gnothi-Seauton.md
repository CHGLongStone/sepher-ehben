#### Sepher Ehben: Hymns to the Logos — Gnothi Seauton

Understand that integrity means “internal consistency” and walk your talk. Unless you do your speech is as meaningless as the opinion of the uninformed. Embody your truth completely, and if you can’t bring anything useful to the table at least the rest of us will know who the assholes are from a distance.

Understand that that life will find a way for you to “eat the shit” that you put into the world. If you want a better diet, change your habits and demonstrate some integrity. Without it you will never find a sense of self to ground yourself in your experience and learn how to discriminate a “hawk from a hand saw” and “sheep shit from marbles and Shinola”.

Understand that your personal sphere of authority is your own self-governace of behavior and choice. Even when the duties of responsibility extend beyond the self it is the office, not the officer that is being saluted. Failing to understand that is a corruption of responsibility and the authority bestowed and invites the metastisization of bureaucracy for generations to come.

Understand that stoking the fire in Chapel Perilous with your personal integrity is the only relevant alchemical transformation you can achieve for what comes of the ore that is purified there cannot be possessed by another. If you have not tested your axioms at the forge they are not your own. Possessing a tool does not make it yours, handling it with mastery does.
