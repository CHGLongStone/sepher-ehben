# Sepher Ehben: Hymns to the Logos — Cold Open Ignition

I’m here to ignite you, incite you  In your passion for critical analysis  A dialysis for your cognitive engagement  But I’ve got way more…

I’m here to ignite you, incite you   
In your passion for critical analysis   
A dialysis for your cognitive engagement   
But I’ve got way more to say than a 15 second sound bite  
Or a 3 minute motown experience can encapsulate  
So I will reference my self in the language I am most comfortable in  
Which is programming punctuated by seven words   
you can’t say on television

Paamayim Nekudotayim   
Or the twice colon in Hebrew  
Is my Scope Resolution Operator  
For my own personal experience   
And I am not here to debate it  
But if you have shared experience   
And you need ears, I have at least…  
A little bit of patience

If I’m throwing down and casting an arrow   
Feel free to pick that up   
And you can shoot it back  
Or return it because we can understand each other  
On some kind of level   
Because engaging with with people  
Who don’t look at things the same way  
Is the best way to broaden your horizon of perspective

I’m not talking about your political ideals  
I’m talking about critical thinking   
Because we approach that the same way   
That we approach intimacy and art   
And it isn’t the aesthetics we imagine   
But the ones that we have habituated   
That we project that play out   
into the corporeal world

The meat-space we inhabit   
Where meta cognition is the one thing   
That truly separates us from “lower animals”  
The Greeks have the first recorded analog   
of that statement…  
When they pronounced at Elysium and Delphi   
To “know thyself”… but how can you do that   
Without meta cognition

Not just understanding what you’re thinking…  
But why you’re thinking it…  
Not loosing touch with but moving past   
The basic urges of the meat-bag   
And the cognitive constraints of social indoctrination   
Taking full account of the shit you’ve been through   
And RISE ABOVE all that shit   
They told you you couldn’t do!

So damn you linear time, even though   
I know you gotta be like that  
Because my meatballs perceptions   
Are not infallible, and are subject to  
Any number of biological, cultural influences  
Or just fucking weird personal proclivities   
So I know when to shut the fuck up   
And listen … maybe I’m not done

But my 3 minutes are up…
