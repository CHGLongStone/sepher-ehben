Every domain of knowledge is like this. These are not ivory towers, these are mountains and mirages. Those with real experience have risked many a dangerous precipice while charlatans sell an imagined description of the journey.

Rare few are able to make the journey by themselves, hose who are enlightened by nature shed light on the routes that are able to gain purchase on these treacherous slopes.
