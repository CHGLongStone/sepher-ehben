relevant section 43:56–1:10:15

When Eric Weinstein introduced gauge theory and spinner (720 degree) symmetry it seemed like a good segue to talk about “complex geometries” in cognition.

As spinorial geometry governs the behavior of the most rudimentary material and boundary constructs of physical matter, axiom constructs form our most rudimentary cognitive constructs and boundary markers.

The issue with most axioms is that they constrain to fixed perspective and do not provide a gauge for 360 degrees of perspective let alone the 720 rotation through 3 axis required to generate a 3 dimensional model.

The Buddhist axiom of compassion may be critical for the development of someone who is highly disagreeable yet cripple the development of someone who is highly agreeable, open and neurotic. These perspectives cannot naturally subsume each other and cannot effectively place their own perspective unless it has been framed within a broader context, providing neither gauge nor symmetry.

The limits of language cannot elucidate the world in the grain of an axiom but we can start to map and consider the topologies in which we arrange these mountains of “for us or against us” into our own private Mordor or soften them with [fertile valleys of clear governance of conduct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6j5aQhaQR4). Yet not so soft they recede into flood plain where no structure can sustain.

Small increases in process efficacy can yield significant results even when leveraging the same basic process.

Increasing the resolution of your personal situational awareness from lists and check boxes to schematic topologies is the first stage in coming to terms with the complexity of the challenges we face in order to engage more effective trust models in our interpersonal interactions.
